 Component Descriptions
1. ✅ Rule Builder
Purpose: Provides a user interface or DSL to define rules using JSON-based grammar.

Functionality:

Allows users to visually or textually compose rules.

Validates structure and syntax.

Supports rule templates, versioning, and testing.

Example:
A rule like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "op": "and",
  "terms": [
    { "field": "age", "comp": "greater than", "value": 30 },
    { "field": "segment", "comp": "equal to", "value": "premium" }
  ]
}
2. 🔄 Data Preparation
Purpose: Prepares and enriches input data before rule evaluation.

Functionality:

Normalizes formats (e.g., dates, nulls).

Adds derived fields or calculated values.

Performs pre-joins or flattening of nested structures.

Why it matters: Ensures consistency and reduces logic duplication in rules.

3. 🧠 Rule Parser
Purpose: Converts the JSON-based rule definition into an internal expression tree or structure.

Functionality:

Validates rule grammar.

Transforms logical operations into executable code.

Handles nested expressions recursively.

Output: Abstract syntax tree (AST) for efficient traversal and execution.

4. 🧩 Dependency Resolver
Purpose: Resolves rule dependencies, especially when rules reference other rules.

Functionality:

Detects cyclic dependencies.

Ensures child rules are evaluated before parent rules.

Performs topological sorting.

Example:
Rule A depends on Rule B → Rule B is evaluated first.

5. 🚀 Rule Optimizer
Purpose: Improves performance by reordering rule terms based on operator cost or selectivity.

Functionality:

Assigns weights to operators (equal to < has all of < exists).

Sorts the terms to short-circuit expensive evaluations.

Caches reusable sub-expressions.

Impact: Minimizes unnecessary data fetches and CPU usage.

6. 🧪 Rule Short-Circuiting
Purpose: Stops evaluation of a rule early when the outcome is already determined.

Functionality:

For AND, stop at first false.

For OR, stop at first true.

Optimization: Combines well with term reordering from Rule Optimizer.

7. 🔍 Unified Data Access Layer
Purpose: Abstracts and manages access to all external data sources.

Functionality:

Supports APIs, databases, caches, and flat files.

Uses schema mappings and JSONPath/SpEL to extract relevant fields.

Minimizes round-trips using batched or parallel queries.

Why it's critical: Decouples rule evaluation from data fetching logic.

8. 📤 Result Dispatcher
Purpose: Collects and publishes the result of rule evaluation.

Functionality:

Returns PASS/FAIL, matched terms, logs.

Can integrate with downstream systems for personalization or targeting.

Stores results in cache or DB for audit and re-use.

📌 Optional Extensions (for future):
Monitoring & Logging – Measure performance of each stage.

Rule Debugger – Visualize rule evaluation path and data used.

Rule Testing Sandbox – Try rules on sample datasets.


Testing Framework
The CCRE Testing Framework ensures the quality, reliability, and correctness of rules before deployment. It enables automated and intelligent testing of rule definitions by simulating real-world conditions and generating verifiable outputs.

🧷 Components:
1. ⚙️ SQL Generator
Purpose: Converts JSON-based rule definitions into SQL queries for validation, regression testing, or live comparison.

Functionality:

Translates operators (equal to, has all of, exists) to SQL equivalents.

Supports nested AND/OR groups with proper precedence.

Joins across multiple data sources when required.

Use Cases:

Validate rule correctness by comparing evaluation result with SQL output on sample DB.

Enable A/B testing: Rule Engine vs SQL Backend.

2. 🤖 Self-Creating Rules (Rule Synthesizer)
Purpose: Auto-generates synthetic rules for testing rule grammar, performance, and edge cases.

Functionality:

Reads schema metadata (field names, types, value ranges).

Randomly or heuristically generates valid rule trees.

Ensures coverage of all operators and corner cases.

Use Cases:

Stress test rule engine with thousands of combinations.

Discover performance bottlenecks with operator-heavy rules.

Enable fuzz testing to catch unexpected crashes or logic errors.

3. 🧠 Testing Agent
Purpose: Orchestrates test execution, manages test data, and tracks evaluation results.

Functionality:

Runs rules against mock or production-like data.

Compares Rule Engine results with SQL output.

Generates pass/fail reports, diffs, and logs.

Supports batch testing, regression packs, and CI/CD hooks.

Features:

Rule version awareness.

Rule change impact analysis.

Detailed failure trace with input data, intermediate outputs, and causes.


Rule Anomaly Detection (Behavior Intelligence Module)
🎯 Purpose:
To continuously monitor the behavior of rules over time and flag anomalies — especially when a rule that consistently evaluates to true for a customer suddenly flips (or vice versa). It uses statistical profiling, historical trends, and rule personality classification to determine whether the flip is expected, tolerable, or concerning.

🧬 Core Concepts:
1. Rule Personality Classification
Each rule is tagged with a personality type, which defines its expected behavior over time:

Personality Type	Description	Flip Expectation
Stable	Should rarely change once true	🔴 Flip is anomalous
Periodic	Naturally fluctuates (e.g., seasonal promotions)	🟡 Flip is tolerable
Reactive	Designed to change based on real-time data	🟢 Flip is normal

2. Anomaly Detection Logic
Historical Evaluation Tracking:

Maintain a rolling history of rule results for each customer.

Use a bitmap or time-series DB to track evaluations.

Statistical Thresholding:

Apply metrics like:

Rule stability score (e.g., % of consistent evaluations).

Recent flip ratio.

Temporal patterns (day, week, month).

3. Flagging System
🚩 Hard Flip: A Stable rule suddenly turns false → immediate investigation.

⚠️ Soft Flip: A Periodic rule flips more frequently than its expected cycle.

✅ Expected Flip: A Reactive rule behaves within normal boundaries.

🔧 Functionality
Classify rules at design time or auto-infer from behavior.

Detect:

Unexpected flips.

Rare evaluations (rule never fired in 90 days).

Conflict with dependent rules (child rule is false, parent becomes true).

Push notifications or logs to observability stack (e.g., Prometheus, ELK).

Optional integration with the Testing Agent for synthetic re-evaluation.

📊 Example Alert
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "rule_id": "R1234",
  "customer_id": "C879",
  "event": "Anomalous Flip",
  "previous_result": true,
  "current_result": false,
  "rule_personality": "Stable",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "message": "Rule R1234 was stable for 90 days, flipped unexpectedly on Jul 30"
}
🧩 Integration Points
Use with Rule Engine Logs to record every evaluation.

Connect with Monitoring Dashboard or Testing Framework.

Combine with Self-Creating Rules to simulate "flippable" conditions.

🛠 Optional Enhancements
Rule behavior visualizations over time (e.g., Sparkline charts).

Machine Learning models to auto-classify rule personality.

Correlation analysis across rules (e.g., cascading flips).

✅ Benefits
Catches silent regressions and data integrity issues.

Helps identify poorly written rules or those based on unstable inputs.

Builds trust in the rule engine by catching unexpected behavior.

Adds intelligence to rule lifecycle management.

Would you like this added into the Draw.io diagram as an optional “Behavior Monitor” box? I can also update the .drawio file to include Testing Framework + Anomaly Detection if you'd like.
