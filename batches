Delivery-cycle levers (5 points)

Product-aligned ownership (fewer handoffs): Cross-functional teams own build→run→outcomes, cutting queue time between groups.

Small batches + fast feedback: Ship in tiny, reversible changes using trunk-based dev, feature flags, and progressive rollouts.

Platform “golden path”: Standard CI/CD, templates, self-service environments—teams spend time shipping, not reinventing pipelines.

Quality & security built-in: Automated tests + policy-as-code guardrails catch issues early without slowing releases with manual gates.

Reliability by default: Strong observability + SLOs + low MTTR keeps teams out of fire-fighting so velocity doesn’t collapse.

People & culture (5 points)

Reward outcomes, not airtime: Promotions/bonuses tied to measurable impact (cycle time, reliability, simplification), not presentation polish.

Dual ladders with equal status: Technical leadership (Staff/Principal) and management paths have comparable recognition and compensation.

Make technical impact “legible”: Use evidence-based reviews (metrics improved, bottlenecks removed, incidents prevented, reuse enabled).

Spotlight invisible work: Regular recognition for platform, DevEx, reliability, and deletion/simplification wins that accelerate everyone.

Protect maker time: Reduce WIP and meeting load; fewer priorities and more focus creates predictable, faster delivery.

Metrics to prove progress (5 points)

Lead time for changes: Track commit/PR → production; the core indicator of cycle-time improvement.

Deployment frequency: More frequent deploys signal smaller batches and healthier delivery flow.

Change failure rate: Measures quality of releases; speed without stability isn’t “world class.”

MTTR: Faster recovery prevents teams from getting stuck in ops mode and preserves velocity.

Flow efficiency indicators: PR cycle time, build/test time, environment wait time, and dependency blockers expose bottlenecks.
